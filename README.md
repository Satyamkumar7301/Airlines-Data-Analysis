## **Business Problem**

Our company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines. We have been providing high-quality air transportation service to our clients for several years, and our primary focus is to ensure a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey for our passengers. However, we are currently facing challenges due to several factors such as stricter enviromental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs. As a result, the company's profitability is under pressure, and they are seeking ways to address this issue. To tackle this challenge, they are looking to conduct an analysis of their database to find ways to increase their occupancy rate, which can help boost the average profit earned per seat.

## **Main Challenges**

1. **Stricter enironmental regulations:** The demand on the airlines industry to decrease its carbon footprint is growing, which has resulted in more strigent environmental laws that raise operating costs and restrict expansion potential.
   
2. **Higher flight taxes:** To solve environmental issues and increase money, governments all around the world are taxing aircraft more heavily, which raised the cost of flying and decrease demand.
   
3. **Tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs:** The lack of trained people in the aviation sector has increased labor costs and increased turnover rates.

## **Objectives**

1. **Increase occupancy rate:** By increasing the occupancy rate, we can boost the average profit earned per seat and mitigate the impact of the challenges we're facing.
   
2. **Improve pricing strategy:** We need to develop a pricing strategy that takes into account the changing market conditions and customer preferences to attract and retain customers.
   
3. **Enhance customer experience:** We need to focus on providing a seamless and convenient experience for our customers, from booking to arrival to differentiate ourselves in a highly competitive industry and increased customers loyalty.

The end goal of this task would be to identify oppertunities to increase the occupancy rate on low-performing flights, which can ultimately lead to increased profitability for the airline.
